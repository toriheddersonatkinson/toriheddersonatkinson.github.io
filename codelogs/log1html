<h1>Non Semantic vs Semantic Tags in HTML</h1>
<p>In HTML, the difference between semantic and non-semantic tags is in the meaning they convey to browsers and
	developers. Semantic tags clearly describe their purpose and the type of content they hold. For instance,
<header>, <article>, <nav>, and <footer> show the role of their content. This clarity makes the structure more
	meaningful. It also improves accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and readability for
	developers. Assistive technologies like screen readers benefit from semantic tags because they provide
	context about the layout of the page.
	In contrast, non-semantic tags such as <div> and <span> do not describe their content. They are merely
	containers for grouping elements or applying styles with CSS. While they are flexible, they need
	additional attributes like classes or IDs to explain their purpose. Overall, semantic tags
	enhance clarity and usability, while non-semantic tags offer structural flexibility without
	inherent meaning.</p>

		<p>Delicious Shepherd Pie, a traditional Irish recipe with ground lamb, vegetables, and covered in mashed
			potatoes. It is my favorite food because it is a comfort food for me and reminds me of my time in Ireland.

			<h2>Instructions:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>This recipe is made in a cast iron skillet or ovenproof pan. You can also cook in a frying pan and
					transfer to a 9 x 13-inch (23 x 33 cm) rectangle baking dish.</li>
				<h3> For Potatoes:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>To a large pan add the potatoes, add cold water until the potatoes are covered and bring to a
						boil. Turn down to a low boil and cook for 20 minutes until tender.
					<li>Add in butter, milk, and seasoning</li>
					<li>Once tender, mash with potatoe masher or mix in standing mixer</li>
				</ol>

				<h4> For Filling:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Preheat oven to 400°F/200°C.</li>
					<li>Add vegetable oil to a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat and add the carrots and onion,
						cook, stirring often until the onions start to soften.</li>
					<li>Add the meat, salt and pepper and cook (breaking up the meat) until it starts to brown. Add the
						garlic and thyme, cook for 3 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the meat, and mix well. Cook for a
						minute or so to cook out the raw flavor.
					</li>
					<li>Add the peas, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce and Guinness (if using), mix well into the
						meat. Add the beef stock/broth and bring to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes until the liquid has
						thickened. Taste for seasoning and add more salt and pepper if needed. Turn off the heat. If not
						baking in the pan, transfer to your baking dish.</li>
					<li>Spread the potato mixture (or pipe with a piping bag for a decorative look) over the beef
						mixture. Make sure you make little peaks so they get a nice brown color and crisp up in the
						oven.</li>
					<li>Place the pan onto a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 15 minutes or until the top is golden
						brown.</li>
					<li>Remove from the oven and allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
